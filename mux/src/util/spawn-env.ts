// Environment for shells the daemon spawns. The daemon is long-lived and usually
// auto-spawned by whichever tmux-server process first needed it — the app server, the
// CLI, or a test runner — so its own process.env carries that ancestor's launch
// baggage. Without scrubbing, every shell of every window inherits it: npm_*
// lifecycle vars mislead tools into thinking they run inside tmux-server's package,
// and app config like AUTH_TOKEN would hand the server's secret to every shell.
// (Same failure tmux-server verified live in its spawnEnv.ts: PORT, AUTH_TOKEN
// and the whole npm_* set were sitting in tmux's global environment.)
//
// Deliberately NOT stripped: vars from the surrounding login/container
// environment (PATH, LANG, ...) — those aren't ours to police, and a user's
// plain shell would have them anyway. TMUX_SERVER_STATE_DIR/TMUX_SERVER_CONFIG_DIR are also
// kept: a `tmux-server-mux` invocation inside a window should target the same daemon
// that spawned it.

// The tmux-server web server's own configuration vars — keep in sync with server config.
