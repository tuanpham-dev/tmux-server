// The Codex half of this extension: the trust blocks its CLI needs in
// ~/.codex/config.toml before it will run a hook at all.
//
// Codex refuses to run any hook whose handler is not trusted there, and it
// does so SILENTLY - no warning, nothing in its log, the hook simply never
// fires. A hooks.json on its own is inert, which is why this file exists and
// why the Claude agent beside it needs nothing.
//
// Verified against codex-cli 0.146.1 on 2026-09-11, in an isolated CODEX_HOME:
// with the blocks absent, not one hook fired; with them present, SessionStart
// and UserPromptSubmit both fired and codex logged "hook: SessionStart
// Completed". Both runs failed to authenticate (401), and the hooks fired
// anyway - so this has nothing to do with quota or login.
//
// The algorithm is reverse-engineered rather than documented: cross-read from
// the Orca desktop app's source (stablyai/orca, src/main/codex/) and then
// confirmed by firing. A codex release that changes the canonical form would
// break it silently again, which is what the paired control test guards.
