// The Codex trust blocks, pinned to a vector measured against the real
// binary. Codex runs no hook whose handler is not trusted in config.toml and
// says nothing when it skips one, so a wrong hash here is invisible until
// someone notices the agent never reports "done" - which is exactly how the
// bug that motivated this file went unexplained for a week.
//
// Tested through activate() rather than by exporting the internals, because
// what has to keep working is the contract core calls: register a transform,
// hand it the file's current text, write back what comes out.
