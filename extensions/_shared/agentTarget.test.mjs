// Tests for agentTarget.ts's pure resolution logic — the shared "what is an
// agent" helper that git-scm, live-preview and ports all route through, and
// that the github and jira extensions vendor byte-identical copies of
// (plans/agent-platform-core.md).
//
// Plain `node --test`, same as statusModel.test.mjs beside it. It imports the
// .ts source directly: Node strips types natively, so no tsx and no build
// step is involved — which also means these run against the exact file the
// bundles inline, not a copy.
//
// `fetch` is stubbed per test rather than mocked at module level, because
// what is being pinned down is that every caller has exactly ONE source: the
// core registry - and that an unreadable registry is a rejection, not a
// silently invented list.
//
// It used to be three-way. Each extension's own agentPrograms / agents
// setting came first, honoured for one version so an upgrade could not
// silently reset a customized list. That grace period was cancelled before
// it shipped, so those settings are gone and the registry can no longer be
// pre-empted - which is what the first test below now pins down.
