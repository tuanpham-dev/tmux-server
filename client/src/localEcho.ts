// addon): every keystroke is forwarded to the PTY the moment it arrives —
// nothing is withheld, so the PTY always holds exactly what the user
// typed and no send/reconcile bookkeeping can corrupt it — while this
// overlay optimistically draws the in-flight tail (text sent whose real
// echo hasn't round-tripped yet) as absolutely-positioned spans over the
// terminal. Where VS Code verifies its predictions byte-by-byte against
// the PTY output stream, this verifies *state*: after each repaint it
// reads the screen, and once the real echo has caught up (or a timeout
// passes without it ever matching — a non-echoing program, or a wrap
// model gone stale) the overlay clears and reality shows through. The
// overlay is purely cosmetic: its worst failure mode is briefly stale
// pixels, never wrong input. Framework-free and engine-agnostic — takes a
// narrow adapter shaped exactly like TerminalEngineHandle's five
// LocalEcho primitives (T2a) so it works unchanged against either engine,
