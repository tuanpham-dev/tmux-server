// The settings document is client-owned and opaque to the server: the client
// defines the schema (settings + keybinding overrides) and merges over its
// own defaults, so the server never needs a schema update when a setting is
// added. The server only guarantees the doc is a plain JSON object and small.
//
// SERVER_OWNED_KEYS are the documented exceptions. A credential has to live
// somewhere the server can read at call time and no client can ever read
// back, and the client's own sync GETs this document, merges client-side,
// and PUTs it back WHOLE — so a value it could see would come straight back
// on the next save, and a value it could write would be a way to smuggle one
// in. Hence: server-owned, restored from disk on every writeSettingsDoc
// (whatever the incoming document says about them is discarded), stripped
// from GET /api/settings (see api.ts), and changed only by the dedicated
// writers below.
//
//   aiSecrets        API keys for the AI providers, keyed by profile id —
//                    read by ai.ts at call time.
//   extensionSecrets per-extension credentials, keyed by extension id then
//                    by name — reached by an extension's server hook through
//                    host.secrets (see extensions.ts). Core serves no route
//                    for these: an extension that wants a browser-facing
//                    field defines its own route on its own router.
