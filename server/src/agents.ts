//   program   what tmux reports as the pane's foreground command, which is

//   command   the full launch line, which is what a "Start work" preset
//             types into a fresh session (launch).
//   hooks     which hook schema the CLI speaks, which is what lets core
//             generate and install its own hook for it (agentHooks.ts).
//
// A sibling of an existing core concept rather than a new one: ai.ts already
// names claude / codex / agy as AI providers, and reads its own list out of
// the settings document exactly the same way.

// taking the install down with it. Core still owns the backup and the
