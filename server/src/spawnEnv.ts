// types `tmux` themselves), everything here lands in tmux's global
// environment and from there into every shell of every pane of every
// session. Confirmed live: PORT, ALLOWED_HOSTS, APP_NAME and the whole npm_*
// launch set were sitting in `show-environment -g`. Beyond the confusion
// (`npm run dev` inside a pane silently binding the production PORT), a set
// AUTH_TOKEN would hand the app's secret to every pane process.

// This server's own configuration vars — everything read from process.env
// for config anywhere in server/src. Keep in sync when adding config.
