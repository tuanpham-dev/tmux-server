// The agent-hook pipeline: one endpoint every AI agent's hooks report to,
// one normalizer, one subscriber table (plans/agent-platform-core.md).
//
// An agent hook used to be each extension's own business — its own pasted
// snippet, its own route, its own correlation scheme. Core owning it end to
// end buys three things no extension could do for itself:
//
//   One hook entry per event, not one per extension. Two extensions both
//   wanting "the turn ended" is one installed hook and one process per turn,
//   not two of each.
//
//   Auth that holds up. agent-monitor's hook curled its extension route with
//   no credentials at all — it worked only because a request with no Origin
//   passes the gate, and would have failed outright on an AUTH_TOKEN server.
//   The endpoint here follows the /api/command-events/report precedent
//   instead: auth-exempt by exact path, gated on loopback plus a custom
//   header it can only be reached with.
//
//   $TMUX_PANE as the correlation key. It is in every pane's environment, so
//   the shim can capture it and core can resolve it to a tmux session. Every
//   consumer used to correlate by the agent's own session id, which only
//   Claude Code sends — which is why nothing but Claude Code ever worked.
//
// Events are transient here: core normalizes and fans out, and nothing is
// stored. Whether anything is remembered is each subscriber's business.
